# My carousel

The carousel is a file system that goes through each file and starts again after it reaches the end. I customized it to include some sound effects and added a background to emphasize a relaxing fantasy theme.

## How it's made:

This project is made using HTML, CSS, and Some JavaScript.

### Optimization:

If i had more time, i would have added more images, made the buttons even more interactive and made the sound effects more fitting.
